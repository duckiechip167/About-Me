            <p>Hi, my name is Emma Fish and I am a Computer Science and Digital Arts major with a Math minor at Clarkson University. Residing in Albany, NY when I am not in Potsdam for half of the year, I have grown to appreciate the Adirondacks and the outdoors. While I love the outdoors, after graduating in 2026, my plans are to get a job in a city. I'd prefer to stay on the east coast, but I am open to moving around while I can afford to. Since starting school, I have been trying to find my passion through my classes and internships. While I have experience in both front end and back end development, I prefer back end and the satisfaction of solving bugs. When I am not at school, I love skiing at Whiteface or Gore. I also love the occasional hike when it is nice out.</p>
