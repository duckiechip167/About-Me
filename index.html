            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I’m Emma Fish, a student at Clarkson University with a passion for creating. I’m pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Digital Arts with a minor in Mathematics. I’m proud to maintain a strong academic record, consistently earning recognition on the Dean’s List.
            </p>
            <p>
                My journey in technology has been shaped by hands-on experiences and impactful projects. During my internship at C Speed, LLC, I worked on advanced AES encryption and decryption functionalities in C#, furthering my understanding of secure software design. As a Webmaster at Clarkson University, I’ve honed my web development skills, ensuring accessibility and performance for a global audience.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love combining creativity with technical expertise, as demonstrated through projects like developing a real-time, multiplayer Tic Tac Toe game in Java and creating efficient data handling systems in C and C++. My work highlights a strong grasp of algorithms, data structures, and programming skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond academics and work, I take pride in leadership roles. As Vice President of Clarkson University’s Pep Band, I’ve developed organizational strategies, led meetings, and coordinated events. Additionally, as the previous Social Media Chair for the Clarkson Orchestra, I managed the group’s online presence and collaborated with peers.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I’m not coding or leading, I enjoy an active lifestyle filled with volleyball, skiing, camping, and photography. Music also plays a central role in my life. I’m a percussionist in the pep band and play the viola in the orchestra.
            </P>
            <p>
                Feel free to connect with me to discuss exciting tech projects, leadership, or anything else you’re passionate about!
